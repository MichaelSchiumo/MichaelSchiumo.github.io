I had thought about learning to code for several years before I finally took the plunge and enrolled at Flatiron School. In fact, this move coincided with many of the changes occurring at the time in my life. For me, coding offered a brand new start, a challenge to be had. In addition, my belief that coding experience is indespensible and borderline necessary assured me that my decision was the right one. Now that I have been coding for several months, I can say that I see the potential for this discipline in all aspects of business. Furthermore, the addition of coding to my specializations in Finance and Russian Language make for an interesting combination, a fact that I hope to leverage when it comes time to apply for jobs. 

So far, I am incredibly pleased with the bootcamp experience; everyone has been so friendly and helpful, but, most of all, their passion for coding truly shines. As the school's credo goes, "Live, Learn, Code" has become my new mantra, as well. I am looking forward to more challenges coming my way in the near future.
