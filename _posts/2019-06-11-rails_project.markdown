This was a tough one. One of the main problems for me was the routing. Figuring out the foundation and the scaffolding (for lack of a better word) was difficult. Additionally, using Omniauth through Google posed quite a few problems, especially when working with the Google Developer website. However, I definitely learned a lot about Rails and the benefits of using it, as well as continuing to use the same CRUD fundamentals to create objects and also add editing and update functionality, for instance.
